\noindent \textbf{Problem 1.} \\ 

(a) In 1995, they introduced blue M\&M's.  Before then, the color mix in a bag of plain M\&M's was 30\% brown, 20\% yellow, 20\% red, 10\% green, 10\% orange, and 10\% tan.  Afterward, it was 24\% blue, 20\% green, 16\% orange, 14\% yellow, 13\% red, 13\% brown.

Suppose there are two bags of M\&M's, one from 1994 and one from 1996 and you are randomly given one M\&M from each bag.  One is yellow, one is green.  Using Bayes's theorem and a probability table to determine the \underline{relative} probability that the yellow M\&M came from the 1994 bag. \\

(b) Evaluate the ``Evidence'' and determine the \underline{normalized} probability that the yellow M\&M came from the 1994 bag. \\

\noindent \textit{Hint: This is similar to how we wrote out the Monty Hall problem in class.} \\

\noindent \textbf{Solution:} \\

(a) The given distribution of M\&M's can be summarized as follows:
%% +------+-----+-----+
%% |Colour|1994 |1996 |
%% +------+-----+-----+
%% |Brown |0.3  |0.13 |
%% +------+-----+-----+
%% |Yellow|0.2  |0.14 |
%% +------+-----+-----+
%% |Red   |0.2  |0.13 |
%% +------+-----+-----+
%% |Green |0.1  |0.2  |
%% +------+-----+-----+
%% |Orange|0.1  |0.16 |
%% +------+-----+-----+
%% |      |0.1  |0.24 |
%% +------+-----+-----+

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}

Colour & 1994 & 1996 \\

Brown & 0.3 & 0.13 \\

Given data: One M\&M was drawn from each sample and one of them is
yellow and another green. To evaluate the relative probablity that the
yellow M\&M was drawn from the 1994 bag (and hence the green from the
1996 bag), define the two hypothesis as:\\
$H_1$: The yellow M\&M is drawn from the 1994 bag and the green M\&M from the
1996 bag.\\
$H_2$: The yellow M\&M is drawn from the 1996 bag and the green M\&M from the
1994 bag.\\

Since we have no prior knowledge about either hypothesis, we should
begin with flat priors- either hypothesis is equally likely. For
probability of the data given the hypothesis we can multiply the
probabilities of drawing the green and yellow M\&Ms from the
respective bag, since they are independent events.
%% +----------+-------+------------+-----------+
%% |Hypothesis|P(H)   |P(D|H)      |P(D|H)*P(H)|
%% |          |       |            |           |
%% +----------+-------+------------+-----------+
%% |$H_1$     |1/2    |(0.2)*(0.2) |0.02       |
%% |          |       |            |           |
%% +----------+-------+------------+-----------+
%% |$H_2$     |1/2    |(0.14)*(0.1)|0.007      |
%% |          |       |            |           |
%% +----------+-------+------------+-----------+

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Hypothesis & P(H) & P(D$|$H) & P(D$|$H)*P(H) \\
 & & & \\
\hline
$H_1$ & 1/2 & (0.2)*(0.2) & 0.02 \\
 & & & \\
\hline
$H_2$ & 1/2 & (0.14)*(0.1) & 0.007 \\
 & & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The relative probability that the yellow M\&M was drawn from the 1994
bag is \fbox{0.02}.\\

(b) The `evidence' is also the probability of the data given all the
possible hypotheses. This can be obtained by summing over the
likelihoods of all the hypotheses.
\begin{equation}
  P(D) = 0.02+0.007 = 0.027
\end{equation}

Hence the normalized probability that the yellow M\&M came from the
1994 bag is:

\begin{equation}
  P(H_1|D) = \frac{P(D|H_1)*P(H_1)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.02}{0.027} \sim 74\%
\end{equation}

The normalized probability of our hypothesis that the yellow M\&M was
drawn from the 1994 bag is \fbox{74\%}.
